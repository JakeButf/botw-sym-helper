# botw-sym-helper
I made this to help in porting over code from https://github.com/fruityloops1/zeldar, which uses an IDA map.

This repo contains py scripts that let you:
- Export symtables from Ghidra in the IDA format
- Create IDA formatted symtables from ghidra .csvs
- Create sym files from a .map
